## Tech Stack

I use simple technology for this project because it is a test project.

- Java 21
- Spring-Boot 4.0.1
- MariaDB as database in the latest version to store data
- Lombok to generate constructor, getter and setter to avoid boilerplate
- Docker as a runtime environment for the database, frontend and backend-api
- thymeleaf for the frontend
- GitLab CI/CD for checking all merge requests with a pipeline and also when merged deploy it
